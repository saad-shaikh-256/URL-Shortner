## 📝 Notes

- **Automatic Deletion**: This project uses a TTL index on MongoDB. All links are automatically deleted from the database exactly 90 days after creation.
- **Security Policy**: The system blocks `javascript`:, `data`:, and `file`: protocols to prevent XSS and session hijacking.
  Production Proxy: In production, the `vercel.json` handles rewrites so that users only see the `make-link.vercel.app`domain.
